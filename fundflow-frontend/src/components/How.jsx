        <p className="intro-text">
          In its simplest form, Crowdfunding is a practice of giving monetary funds to overcome specific social,
          cultural, or economic hurdles individuals face in their daily lives.

          <p className="explanation-text">
            Let us assume an individual, unfortunately, meets with an accident on the road. His medical expenses and
            hospital bills start piling up. Now he needs â‚¹5 Lakh to pay his expensive medical bills. Fortunately, his
            best friend signed up on FundFlow crowdfunding platform, completed the process of submitting valid documents
            needed for verification. In a few minutes, he created a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for his
            friend's medical expenses. Now, this campaign can be shared with all his near and dear ones through
            WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and E-mail. In a matter of few minutes, funds start coming in to
            support the financial needs of the injured friend.
